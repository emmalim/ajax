<h2>Logged in as User <span id="login_uid">{{ uid }}</span></h2>

<p>This form stands in for a "real" login form that would have both a
userID and a password, and would check the password against encrypted
passwords in the database. But we're not doing that. Any UID should
work: try your own, or any small integer.</p>
<p>Your back-end will support both old-fashioned non-Ajax logins and
Ajax logins. The two buttons submit to different back-end routes.</p>
